# AI600_PA1
This README is designed to be the professional front page of your GitHub repository. It covers everything from the NYC Airbnb dataset context to the technical implementation of your neural network.AI600: Deep Learning - Assignment 1Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) Spring 2026📋 Project OverviewThis repository contains the implementation for Assignment 1, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the construction of a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using NumPy, followed by a comparative analysis using PyTorch. The goal is to classify New York City Airbnb listings into one of four price categories (price_class) based on features like location, room type, and amenity scores.+2The DatasetThe data consists of ~41,000 training samples and ~7,000 test samples. Features include:Categorical: neighbourhood_group, room_type.Numerical: minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, availability_365, amenity_score .Target: price_class (0: Budget, 1: Moderate, 2: Premium, 3: Luxury).🛠️ Installation & Setup1. Virtual EnvironmentSince this project was developed on Fedora, it uses a local virtual environment to manage dependencies without affecting system Python.Bash# Create the environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
2. DependenciesTo avoid downloading massive NVIDIA CUDA drivers (especially for HP Spectre or non-GPU laptops), we use the CPU-only version of PyTorch.Bash# Install core data science stack and CPU-only Torch
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ipykernel
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
